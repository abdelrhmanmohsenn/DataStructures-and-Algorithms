# Data Structures and Algorithms 

ðŸ“š This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C. Below is a brief overview of what is included:

## Data Structures

1. **Stack Array (Static)**: A stack implemented using a fixed-size array.
2. **Stack Array (Dynamic)**: A stack implemented using a dynamically resizing array.
3. **Queue**: A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
4. **Singly Linked List**: A collection of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence.
5. **Doubly Linked List**: A linked list in which each node keeps an explicit reference to the node before it and a reference to the node after it.

## Algorithms

1. **Search Algorithms**:
   - *Linear Search*: An algorithm that searches for a target value within an array by sequentially checking each element.
   - *Binary Search*: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.

2. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - *Bubble Sort*: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - *Insertion Sort*: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
   - *Selection Sort*: A simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted, and repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.
